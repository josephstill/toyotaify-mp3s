As of 2021, the software that manages MP3 playback from Fat32 USB devices in
Toyota vehicles doesn't sort tracks by track number when listening to an
album. Instead the tracks are sorted alphabetically by title. This podantic
application will prepend disk and track numbers to each MP3 so that your
albums will play in order.

'''
Toyotaify [-h] (--dir DIR | --file FILE) [--recurse | --no-recurse]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --dir DIR, -d DIR     the directory containing mp3s to process
  --file FILE, -f FILE  process one mp3 file
  --recurse, --no-recurse
                        Search through directories and subdirectories
                        (default: True)
